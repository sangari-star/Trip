Responsive layout using CSS for different screen sizes

Attractive design with destination cards, ratings, and photos

Navigation bar for easy access to sections like Home, Destinations, Reviews, and Contact

Interactive hover effects and transitions for a modern look

Review section styled to mimic real travel feedback
